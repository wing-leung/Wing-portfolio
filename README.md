# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cylistic bike-share analysis case study!
As a junior data analyst of Cyclistic’s marketing analyst team, I analyse historical data of the company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. The main tools I use are spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau.

## Scenario
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. There are two types of customers using the company’s services: casual riders, customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes; members, those who purchase annual memberships.
Cyclistic’s financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes that maximising the number of annual memberships is the key for the company’s success.

The marketing analytics team wants to understand the difference in usage of the company’s services between casual riders and annual members. From these insights, the team will develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The primary stakeholders for this project include Cyclistic’s director of marketing and the Cyclistic executive team. The Cyclistic marketing analytics team are secondary stakeholders.
